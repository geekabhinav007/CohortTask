# Quantum Computing Task

This repository contains code for a simple quantum computing task implemented using Qiskit.

## Dependencies

To run the code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Qiskit
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using pip:

## Files

- `largestOutofTwo_Solution.ipynb`: Contains the code for the quantum computing task.
- `token.txt`: Contains the IBM Quantum Experience API token. (You need to obtain this token from the IBM Quantum Experience website.)
- `README.md`: This file.

## Instructions

1. Install the dependencies using `pip`.

2. Obtain an IBM Quantum Experience API token and save it in the `token.txt` file.

3. Open `largestOutofTwo_Solution.ipynb` and modify the `number1` and `number2` variables to the numbers that you want to compare.

4. Run `largestOutofTwo_Solution.ipynb` to run the quantum circuit.

The program will output the larger number.

## Credits

The code is based on the tutorial provided in the Qiskit documentation.
