# QC Mentorship Program Screening Tasks

Welcome to my Github repository for the QC Screening Task. This is my submission for the coding task designed to evaluate potential candidates for the QOSF mentorship program. I have completed a set of quantum programming exercises using Python and the Qiskit framework, which demonstrate my understanding of quantum computing concepts and proficiency in Python programming.

In this repository, you will find my solution to the QOSF screening task, which includes detailed documentation and comments to explain my thought process and approach to each exercise. My submission is organized according to the instructions and guidelines provided by the QOSF mentorship program, and I have used the submission template provided to ensure that my solution is easy to review and evaluate.

## Overview of my Approach

I used the Qiskit framework to develop my solution to the screening tasks. For each task, I started by analyzing the problem statement and requirements, and then I designed a quantum circuit that would satisfy those requirements. I used the Qiskit functions to construct and manipulate quantum circuits, and I included comments and documentation throughout my code to explain my thought process and approach.

## Task 1: Find the Largest Number

In this task, you are given two integers, either positive or negative, and the challenge is to generate a quantum algorithm that returns which number is the larger one. You should consider an appropriate number of qubits and explain why your proposal is valid for all kinds of numbers.

Instructions:

- Create a function called find_the_largest_number that takes in two integer parameters number_1 and number_2, and returns the largest number between the two.

- Use a QC framework that works with quantum circuits such as Qiskit, Cirq, or PennyLane.
- Print your quantum circuit and explain why your proposal is valid for all kinds of numbers.

## Example

```python
A = find_the_largest_number(5, -6)
print(A)
Output: 5
```

## Additional Comments

I am excited to be considered for the QOSF mentorship program, and I hope that my submission demonstrates my passion and dedication to quantum computing. Thank you for taking the time to review my work, and I look forward to the opportunity to learn from and contribute to the quantum open source community.
